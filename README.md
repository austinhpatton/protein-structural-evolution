# protein-structural-evolution
Research into macroevolutionary patterns of protein structural evolution conducted at Arcadia Science. This work may be broken down into numerous components, including the inference/identification of remote homologs across eukaryotes, patterns of gene-family evolution, and the extent to which protein structure and amino acid sequences correspond to one-another.
