    "In general, EukProt is a very useful collection of proteomes, but includes data from disparate sources with varying annotation styles/resolution. For instance, the proteomes of many species in EukProt are derived from transcriptome assemblies and thus lacking specific protein accessions. In contrast, other proteomes are sourced from RefSeq or ensemble, and thus have standing protein accessions, but these can vary in format to a frustrating degree, necessitating a fair amount of coaxing into a usable format. We are using UniProt accessions as they are used by AlphaFold2 to name individual protein structure prediction files, and because these accessions are readily used to pull our other functionally relevant details about each protein."

It does seem that if the column \"Actions_Prior_to_Use\" is anything other than \"none\", it is unlikely that there are usable accessions - these exceptions can probably be safely be ignored.\n",

    "**3) Ensembl_Genomes_Protein:**\n",

    "     - But, if you thought the protist database was foolproof, you're mistaken - Phytopythium vexans is in the protist set, and for this species the IDs are along the lines of 'EPrPV00000013083' - and this returns nothing when querying to UniProt. I don't know of any steadfast rules here. \n",

    "## **Alrighty now.... Let's get some uniprot IDs!**\n",
    "So before, I thought I was being clever by submitting individual uniprot IDs in parallel with gnu-parallel, looping through species. Turns out that is WILDLY inefficient, and motivated by a bit of a misunderstanding of how curl works. So instead, let's give a run-down of why I though I would do this, and what we'll do instead. \n",
    "\n",

    "## **_Curl: The art of submitting_**\n",
    "In past efforts to submit all protein accessions simultaneously for ID mapping, I (and others) ran into the dreaded error:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bash: /usr/bin/curl: Argument list too long\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is what you get when you try to submit a bash command that is obscenely long - for instance, submitting 14974 ids at once by storing them all in a variable (= ids) and submitting using '--form \"ids=$ids\"'\n",
    "This is a limitation of the shell, not curl. This can be dealt with by instead writing all of the form submissions (i.e. \"from, to, and IDs\") out to a file that can be specified/fed to curl using -d. \n",
    "So the file would read as, for example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "from=RefSeq_Protein&to=UniProtKB&ids=XP00001.1,XP00002.1,XP00003.1,XP00004.1,XP00005.1,XP00006.1,XP00007.1,etc\n",
    "```\n",
    "...and would be provided to curl and specified using -d @forms.txt. Note that when specifying a file, the file needs to be preceded by the \"@\" symbol. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Let's provide an example.**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Store the species as a variabel\n",
    "spp=Acanthamoeba_castellanii\n",
    "\n",
    "# read in the protein ids and store as a variable (again, one protein ID is listed per line. \n",
    "ids=$(cat data/EukProt/TCS/data/protein-ids/$spp-Ensembl-ProtIDs.txt | tr '\\n' ',')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Because the last line in the protein ID file is blank, the last character will be a comma. \n",
    "# You can check this:\n",
    "echo ${ids: -1}\n",
    "\n",
    "# and then easily delete\n",
    "ids=${ids::-1}\n",
    "\n",
    "# And combine the three fields and echo to a file\n",
    "echo \"from=Ensembl_Genomes_Protein&to=UniProtKB&ids=$ids\" > $spp-form.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "# And now submit the id mapping job with curl!\n",
    "curl -d @form.txt https://rest.uniprot.org/idmapping/run\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "All the rest of the process is the same - this approach is just so, so much faster. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we'll do now is to still use gnu-parallel across species, but it'll just be a single ID mapping job that we submit. The following cell generates three scripts, one for each proteome source (Ensembl, GenBank, & RefSeq), and does so by creating a unique header for each source, and then a general, source independent tail to the script. We then concatenate the source-specific headers with the source-independent tails into their full bash scripts, and clean up."
