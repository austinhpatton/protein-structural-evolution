## Programatic protein ID mapping from RefSeq, GenBank and Ensembl to UniProtKB
#### This directory contains a series of scripts and tutorials that pertain to the mapping of protein IDs from disparate sources to UniProtKB. 
- This code is currently tailored to maipulating data from the EukProt database, but could be made more general with relatively little effort. 
- Similarly, the code is in development still, but can eventually be turned into a workflow that takes a list of protein IDs, and the data source hyperlink, and returns the results from ID mapping to UniProtKB.
